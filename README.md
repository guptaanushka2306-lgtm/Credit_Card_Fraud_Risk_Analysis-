# Credit_Card_Fraud_Risk_Analysis-

 ## Project Overview

- This project analyzes credit card fraud risk using a Kaggle dataset. The dashboard was built in Power BI to explore fraudulent transaction patterns, risk levels, and trends across states, months, and transaction categories.

Data cleaning and transformation were performed using Power Query, and fraud-related KPIs were calculated with DAX. The goal is to support early detection of fraud and help organizations reduce financial risk.


## Objectives

- Analyze fraudulent transaction patterns by fraud type, state, and merchant category.

- Categorize transactions into Low, Medium, High, and Critical risk levels.

- Detect seasonal/monthly fraud transaction spikes.

- Highlight high-risk fraud types and geographies.

- Build an interactive dashboard for fraud monitoring.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** → Dashboard creation & visualization.

- **Power Query** → Data cleaning and transformation.

- **DAX** → Calculated measures and KPIs.

- **Dataset**: Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Dataset.

## Dataset 


## Key Insights

- **Fraud Rate**: 28.6% of total transactions were fraudulent.

- **Top Fraud Type**: Card Not Present fraud was the most common.

- **High-Risk States**: Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Rajasthan reported the highest fraud cases.

- **Seasonality**: Fraudulent transactions peaked in December (34 cases).

- **Risk Distribution**: Most frauds were Low (42.42%) and Medium (27.93%) risk.

## Dashboard Features

- **Fraud Type vs. Category** → Breakdown of transaction amounts.

- **Fraud Risk Distribution** → Donut chart showing Low, Medium, High, and Critical risks.

- **Fraud by State** → Geographical distribution of fraudulent cases.

- **Fraud by Month** → Monthly trend analysis of fraud.

- **Filter Panel** → Slicers for fraud type, state, and merchant category.

  

## Business Impact

- Enables fraud monitoring with interactive insights.

- Helps in early fraud detection for critical risk transactions.

- Supports data-driven decision making for financial institutions.

## Final Conclusion

- This project successfully demonstrates how Power BI can be used to analyze and monitor credit card fraud risk using real-world inspired data from Kaggle. By applying Power Query for data cleaning and DAX for KPI calculations, the dashboard provides deep insights into fraud patterns across fraud types, risk categories, states, and time periods.

**The analysis reveals that**:

- Card Not Present transactions are the most vulnerable to fraud.

- Fraud cases peak during December, indicating seasonal risk.

- States like Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Rajasthan report the highest number of fraudulent transactions.

- Most fraud cases fall under Low and Medium risk, but Critical risk transactions still pose a significant threat.


This dashboard can help financial institutions and fraud risk teams with early detection, continuous monitoring, and better fraud prevention strategies.
